        <h3>Kyungdong University - South Korea 2024</h3>
        <img src="images/kdu-contest.png" alt="Kyungdong University coding contest" />
        <p>
            This coding contest pushed me to new levels. Diving headfirst into the time-bound challenges, I initially felt overwhelmed by the unfamiliar algorithms and complex problem-solving demands. The initial few problems exposed gaps in my knowledge of data
            structures, and the pressure to code efficiently added another layer of difficulty. However, I persevered.
            <br /><br />I was among the few who worked solo while others worked side by side with their patners. Each solved problem, even if it took multiple attempts, boosted my confidence and refined my understanding. By the end, I was tackling problems
            I wouldn't have dared before, implementing elegant solutions thanks to the contest's pressure cooker environment. While the final ranking was rewarding, the true victory lies in the newfound skills and problem-solving tenacity I gained through
            the contest's challenges.

        <h3>Power Learn Project - Kenya 2022</h3>
        <img src="images/plp.jpeg" alt="Power learn project kenya" />
        <p>
            The coding bootcamp felt like an immersive training ground. Grasping a new programming language was like learning a whole new way of thinking. Syntax errors became my constant companions, and debugging felt like deciphering an alien code.
            <br /><br />But the supportive environment of the bootcamp was my saving grace. Fellow classmates, most facing similar hurdles, became my comrades-in-arms. Late nights fueled by coffee and pizza were spent huddled around laptops, explaining
            concepts and debugging each other's code. The teamwork not only fostered deeper understanding but also forged strong friendships and a shared sense of accomplishment.
            <br /><br /> Despite the challenges, the bootcamp wasn't just about code; it was about building connections with like-minded individuals who are now part of my professional network, ready to tackle the exciting world of development together.
            <br /><br /> At the end, we held an event in the Kenya International Convention Center where all participants gathered to share our projects, showcase The Power Learn Project (PLP) experience.
